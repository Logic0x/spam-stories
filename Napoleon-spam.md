Napoleon was a boy living in Africa in the late 1980s. However, he had a problem. He was not a cool kid you see? Napoleon’s family was not that rich meaning that they did not have a lot of money. All of Napoleon’s friends were rich or had a little money so they could all afford the coolest jet black backpacks of their time. It was the fad back then you see. Because Napoleon could not afford the jet black coolest backpack, he asked his mother. Napoleon’s father was in France doing some business.
“Hey mama Napoleon asked his mom”, “may I receive a coolest jet black backpack of our time? All my friends have it” “oh honey you know how it is we don’t have money” “please mom I won’t ask for a birthday present or Christmas present” “well ok fine I will try to find one for you...” “thank you mother god bless Godspeed” Napoleon bid farewell to his mother and continued to do his homework from yesterday night.
The next day, Napoleon was just doing his normal day routine after getting back from school when suddenly out of nowhere, his mom shot out beneath the bed and said suprise and gave Napoleon the coolest jet black backpack of the century. But something was wrong.
“Mom, why is there a massive pony on the back of the backpack?”
“I don’t know Napoleon you ask me”
“Mom you got the wrong backpack”
“What it’s jet black and cool”
“Mom it’s a rip off china bootleg backpack”
“So what you get an extra pony and it’s still cool. Doesn’t it make it cooler and plus it was cheap too!”
“Uuhhhfg whatever”
Napoleon was not very satishfied and he got bullied even more for using the coolest jet black backpack plus pony and bringing it to school. “Hahahah what a loser what are you retarted” Napoleon became sad however he learned one lesson. If you want something, work for it yourself. 10 years later, Napoleon got money and could now afford the backpack bye GTG eat
